I am thrilled to announce that I have joined the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris as a researcher and curator of Hymenoptera. In this new role, I will focus on the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary history of gall-inducing insects, with a particular emphasis on Cynipidae (gall wasps). I look forward to contributing to the museum's mission of exploring and preserving biodiversity, while continuing my research on the fascinating interactions between insects and plants.
