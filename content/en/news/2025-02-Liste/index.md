- the sharing of recent publications and bibliographical resources,
- requests to send or exchange specimens,
- organize field trips and other joint events,
- reporting and discussing interesting field observations,
- sharing opportunities (calls for projects, internship or collaboration offers).
If you're working on cecidia, or simply curious to learn more about these plant-organism interactions, don't hesitate to join the list!
