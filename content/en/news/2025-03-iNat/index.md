Launch of the project "Observatoire francophone des Galles" on iNaturalist.

<!--more-->

We are pleased to announce the creation of an iNaturalist project dedicated to galls: the [Observatoire francophone des Galles](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/observatoire-francophone-des-galles). The aim of this project is to collect observations of galls made by French-speaking naturalists, without geographical restrictions. 

**How can you get involved?**
To join the project, all you need to do is : 
   1️⃣ Have an account on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/). 
   2️⃣ Become a member of the [Observatoire francophone des Galles](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/observatoire-francophone-des-galles). 
   3️⃣ Annotate your observations of galls: in the right-hand bar, under Annotations, select “Galle” in the “Signe de présence” tab. 
Once you are a member of the project, all your correctly annotated gall observations will be automatically integrated into the project. 

**Why a new iNaturalist project?**
This project complements existing initiatives such as [Galles de France](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/galles-de-france-galls-of-france) or [European Plant Gall Faunistics](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/european-plant-galler-faunistics), which are limited to certain geographical areas. Here, all members' gall observations from all over the world will be accessible in one place, offering a broader overview and facilitating exchanges. 

**A collaborative space**
The "Project Diary" section will enable us, as project administrators, to share observation objectives and highlight remarkable sightings. In this way, the project can become a kind of social network for the Galla Gallica group. Visit iNaturalist to share your observations, if you're interested.
