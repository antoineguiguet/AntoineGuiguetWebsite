        Description of my research.The emergence of novel traits is often preceded by a potentiation phase, when all the genetic components necessary for producing the trait are assembled. However, elucidating these potentiating factors is challenging. We have previously shown that an anthocyanin-activating R2R3-MYB, STRIPY, triggers the emergence of a distinct foliar pigmentation pattern in the monkeyflower Mimulus verbenaceus. Here, using forward and reverse genetics approaches, we identify three potentiating factors that pattern STRIPY expression: MvHY5, a master regulator of light signaling that activates STRIPY and is expressed throughout the leaf, and two leaf developmental regulators, MvALOG1 and MvTCP5, that are expressed in opposing gradients along the leaf proximodistal axis and negatively regulate STRIPY. These results provide strong empirical evidence that phenotypic novelties can be potentiated through incorporation into preexisting genetic regulatory networks and highlight the importance of positional information in patterning the novel foliar stripe.
